Project Summary

The DriverPass project was developed for a client who wanted a web-based system to help students prepare for their driving exams. The system enables users to register accounts, purchase lesson packages, schedule sessions with instructors, and receive progress updates—all in one platform designed for efficiency and ease of use.

What I Did Well

I clearly documented the system requirements and aligned them with the client’s goals. My business requirements captured both functional and non-functional needs, while the system design included detailed UML diagrams that effectively represented user flow and process logic.

Areas for Improvement

If I were to revise one part of my work, I would expand the system design to include more sequence diagrams to better illustrate component interactions. I’d also add technical details about data security and error handling for a more complete and realistic design.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I translated user needs into features by analyzing requirements and ensuring usability—for example, implementing automated email confirmations and real-time scheduling. Meeting user needs is critical because even a technically strong system fails if it doesn’t provide a good user experience.

Approach to Software Design

My approach involves requirement gathering, system modeling, and iterative refinement. I use UML diagrams to visualize workflows and structure, ensuring clarity across teams. In future projects, I plan to apply Agile methods and prototyping to collect feedback early and improve design accuracy and adaptability.# DriverPass
